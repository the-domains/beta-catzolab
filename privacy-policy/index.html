PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p><h3>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?</h3><p>When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address or other details to help you with your experience.</p><h3>When do we collect information?</h3><p>We collect information from you when you register on our app or enter information on our site.</p><h3>How do we use your information?</h3><p>We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:</p><ul><li>To track your progress in the game.</li></ul><h3>How do we protect visitor information?</h3><p>We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards. Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p><h3>Do we use 'cookies'?</h3><p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p><h3>We use cookies to:</h3><ul><li>Understand and save user's preferences for future visits.</li><li>Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third party services that track this information on our behalf.</li></ul><p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p><h3>Third Party Disclosure</h3><p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p><p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p><h3>Third Party Disclosure</h3><p>Third party links</p><p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p><h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3><p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p><h3>CAN SPAM Act</h3><p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p><h3>Contacting Us</h3><p>If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy you may contact us using the form <a href="https://www.catzolab.com/contact">here</a></p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="25"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/85404e2f-b7aa-4202-99cf-1b8b1b9578c3.png" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="26"/></a><h2 data-reactid="27"><a data-reactid="28">beta CatzoLab</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="30"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="31"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="32"></div></section></div></div>
